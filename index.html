passphrase.io - zero knowledge privacy online notepad

*note: This is an updated version of passphrase.io with improved security.  If you used passphrase.io prior to July 2016, please visit https://passphrase.io/old to recover your notepad.

Enter a passphrase and hit enter to load the notepad associated with that passphrase. Click save to encrypt and store your notepad.  Access your notepad again by entering your passphrase.

Your passphrase and notepad are encrypted in your browser, and plaintext data is never sent to or stored on the server.  If you forget your passphrase, there is no recovery process.  Your passphrase is case sensitive.

For high security, use a long passphrase that is difficult to guess and never used in any song, literature, or media.  Short phrases lead to high visibility, and text can be overwritten by anyone who stumbles upon it.

Technical details: Using client-side JavaScript, your notepad is encrypted with AES256 encryption, using your passphrase as the key.  Your passphrase is run through the memory-intensive scrypt key derivation function (N=2^18, r=8, p=1, dkLen=32), followed by a SHA256 hash. The hash and encrypted notepad is then sent to our server for storage.  We have no way of knowing your passphrase or decrypting your notepad.

Terms of Service:

By using passphrase.io ("Service"), you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions. 

Our Service displays content generated by other users when the passphrase can be guessed.  This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it available.  Anyone reserves the right to remove or modify any defamatory, offensive, or illegal content.

We are not liable for any information stored with the Service and loss of data resulting from weak passphrases, malicious attacks, or database failures.

We reserve the right to modify or terminate the Service for any reason, without notice at any time.  We reserve the right to alter these Terms of Service at any time.
